## Hello, my name is Maria!

## About

The beginning of my career was marked by teaching physics and mathematics to IT students. I was captivated by the idea that I could make mathematics and physics engaging and understandable. This is what I dedicated myself to for 6 years.

Subsequently, I realized my desire to progress further. With my technical education and a profound interest in programming in mind, I decided to pursue a career as a developer.
